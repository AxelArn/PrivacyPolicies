Privacy Policies

Welcome to the Reaction Time Games application for Android!

This app is developed by Studio AY and is available on Google Play.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. Any data created by you will be stored on your device only.

But we show ads in the app (AdMob) and use Firebase for collecting anonymous analytics and use Google Play Services for creating leaderboards, so our app may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.

If you have any question or remark about the app, its security, or the protection of you privacy, feel free to send me an email.

Best regards,

Studio AY.
